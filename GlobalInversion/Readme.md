This files run all the possible solutions for a three layered model. The model parameteres are: 3 layer resistivities and 2 thicknesses
nsl is the number of samples for each parameter

Run ParallelEMforward.py: modify the number of jobs for the number of cores available.
Creates the hypercube of solutions for a number of samples nsl

GlobalInvEmpy.ipnyb: Calculates the hypercube for a number of samples nsl. Non parallelized
